pywdns
======

This is `pywdns`, a Python extension module implemented in
[Cython](http://cython.org/) for the [wdns](https://github.com/farsightsec/wdns)
C library.

Building
--------

Building from a git checkout requires a C compiler, Python, Cython, and the
`wdns` library to be installed first. Distribution tarballs ship with a copy of
the Cython-generated code and do not require Cython to actually be installed.

`pywdns` is built by running `setup.py`:

    python setup.py build

To update for newer wdns.h header, run:

    python setup.py gen_constants
